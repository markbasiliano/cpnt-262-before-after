3. **Exponential Notation**: There's a method that allows you to express numbers in scientific notation (e.g., 1.23e+5).
4. **Fixed Decimals**: You can create a string representation of a number with a fixed number of decimal places using a specific method.
5. **Floating-Point Precision**: Control the total number of digits in the string representation of a number with a dedicated method.

### STRINGS
1. **Get Length**: Strings have a property that tells you how many characters they contain.
2. **Extract Substring (1)**: Methods are available to extract a portion of a string based on a starting position and the desired length.
3. **Extract Substring (2)**: There are methods that let you extract a portion of a string by defining a starting and ending position.
4. **Access the first character**: Remember how indexing works with strings and how to access characters at specific positions.
5. **Access the last character**: Combine your knowledge of string length and character indexing.
